## How to Start Up Your Experiments?

To conduct a experiment, datasets, toolchains, hardware configuration, evaluation statistics, prior work  and its results should be taken into consideration. This collection is hosted on [*Google Sheet*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xtd4_ZrPQTgrsA7bieR5n3hLcjWxKuWoUsz-HyZn0do/edit?usp=sharing) for the convenience of editing. Also, some toolkits may help improve the quality of life! üöÄ
